title: Causal Discovery with Multi-Domain LiNGAM for Latent Factors
abstract: Discovering causal structures among latent factors from observed data is
  particularly significant yet challenging problem. Despite some efforts for this
  problem, existing methods focus on the single-domain data only. In this paper, we
  propose Multi-Domain Linear Non-Gaussian
  Acyclic Models for LAtent Factors (MD-LiNA), where the causal structures
  from different domains may be different, but they have a shared causal structure
  among latent factors of interest. The model enriches the causal representation for
  multi-domain data. We propose an integrated two-phase algorithm to estimate the
  model. In particular, we first locate the latent factors and estimate the factor
  loading matrix. Then to uncover the shared causal structure among latent factors
  of interest, we derive a score function based on the characterization of independence
  relations between external influences and the dependence relations between multi-domain
  latent factors and latent factors of interest. Experimental results on synthetic
  data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
